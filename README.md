# wordpress-vagrant-setup
This repository contains my Vagrant configuration file for setting up a local WordPress development environment. The configuration installs and configures the necessary software stack including Apache, MySQL, and PHP. It automates the installation of WordPress, sets up a database and user, and configures Apache2 to serve the WordPress site.
